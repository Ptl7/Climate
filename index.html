📅 50-Year Plan Breakdown (2025-2075)

📌 Phase 1 (2025-2040) – Laying the Foundation (15 Years)

🌞 Goal: Rapid infrastructure expansion, industry shift, and large-scale CO₂ removal deployment.

🔋 1. Energy Transition (Renewables & Grid Expansion)

✅ Deploy solar, wind, hydro, & geothermal worldwide (40% of global energy mix by 2040).
✅ Smart AI-powered grids to manage energy demand & supply efficiently.
✅ Fusion R&D investments (First commercial reactors by 2040).
✅ Space-based solar power prototypes launched.

🌱 2. CO₂ Capture & Climate Restoration

✅ 10,000 Direct Air Capture (DAC) plants operational worldwide (capture 2 billion tons CO₂ per year).
✅ Global reforestation programs (2 trillion trees planted).
✅ Biological carbon sinks (genetically modified algae & trees).

🏭 3. Industrial Transition

✅ Heavy industries (steel, cement, aviation) start shifting to green alternatives.
✅ Fossil fuel phase-out agreements begin.
✅ Carbon pricing introduced globally ($50-100/ton).

💰 4. Economic & Financial Reforms

✅ Green bonds & investments → $10T fund established.
✅ **10% of global GDP pooled into a Climate Transition Fund.
✅ Circular economy policies implemented → Recycling & efficiency incentives.
