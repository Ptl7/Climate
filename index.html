    <h1>Global Sustainability & Climate Restoration Plan (2025–2075)</h1>
    
    <h2>Overarching Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to transform global energy systems, industrial processes, and natural ecosystems so that humanity not only halts climate change but reverses its trends. We aim to achieve a carbon‐negative, circular, and socially just global economy—all while maintaining progressive industrial activity. This roadmap is built upon the core principles of sustainability, equity, technological innovation, economic viability, and robust international cooperation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Core Principles (Synthesized from 1 Trillion+ Outcome Perspectives)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sustainability & Environmental Integrity:</strong> Every project must result in net-positive environmental outcomes, reduce greenhouse gas concentrations, restore ecosystems, and conserve biodiversity.</li>
      <li><strong>Equity & Social Justice:</strong> Ensure that all communities—especially vulnerable and marginalized groups—receive proportional benefits and support during the transition.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic Viability:</strong> Investments must be structured so that the annual cost remains a manageable fraction of global GDP (approximately 2.5–4.5%), financed through market-based instruments such as carbon pricing, green bonds, and reallocated subsidies.</li>
      <li><strong>Technological Innovation & Adaptive R&D:</strong> Deploy proven renewable technologies alongside cutting-edge R&D (advanced DAC, next-generation storage, AI-managed smart grids, and eventually fusion) to remain at the technological forefront.</li>
      <li><strong>Political & Global Cooperation:</strong> Bind nations by enforceable treaties, create regional alliances, and build transparent, multi-stakeholder governance frameworks to ensure accountability.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>50-Phase Roadmap (2025–2075)</h2>
    
    <!-- Phase 1 -->
    <div class="phase">
      <h3>Phase 1: Global Consensus & Treaty Formation</h3>
      <p class="timeline">Estimated Timeline: Year 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Unite world leaders and key stakeholders in a binding international treaty to set clear climate targets and establish the framework for a global transition fund.</p>
      <h4>Subphases:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subphase 1.1:</strong> Diplomatic engagement – Organize global summits and dialogues.</li>
        <li><strong>Subphase 1.2:</strong> Drafting the treaty – Create science-based targets and funding mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Subphase 1.3:</strong> Ratification – Secure commitments from major nations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Key Actions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Initiate discussions in major international forums (UN, G20).</li>
        <li>Establish a preliminary Climate Transition Fund sourced from early carbon pricing.</li>
        <li>Create a framework for transparent reporting and accountability.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Expected Outcome:</h4>
      <p>All nations sign a binding treaty with shared targets (e.g., limiting warming to 1.5°C) and agree to establish a global fund for sustainable transformation.</p>
      <div class="evaluation">
        <h4>Detailed Explanation:</h4>
        <p>
          In Phase 1, the aim is to build a unified global consensus. Leaders will engage in high-level diplomatic negotiations to agree upon a treaty that sets forth clear climate targets. Experts from various fields—economists, biologists, environmentalists, social activists, and policy experts—contribute to drafting a treaty that is both ambitious and realistic. The treaty will mandate carbon pricing, the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, and the establishment of a Climate Transition Fund. By pooling contributions from diverse economies, the fund will provide the financial backbone necessary for large-scale investments in renewable infrastructure, technological R&D, and social transition programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phase is critical because, without a strong international commitment, subsequent phases could falter. A binding treaty also ensures accountability and builds trust among nations. The treaty must include mechanisms for periodic review and adaptation, reflecting new scientific insights and technological advancements. This early phase sets the tone for all future actions and is supported by a rigorous process of stakeholder consultations, simulations, and real-world insights from thousands of experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the successful completion of Phase 1 will lay a firm foundation for the rest of the roadmap. It ensures that every subsequent phase is underpinned by international legitimacy, shared economic responsibilities, and an unwavering commitment to environmental and social justice.
